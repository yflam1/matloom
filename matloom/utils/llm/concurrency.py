    LLM calls are I/O-bound, so a bounded thread pool is the right tool: it
    overlaps many in-flight requests while ``max_concurrency`` caps how many
    hit the provider at once (keeping you under server-side rate limits). The
    underlying OpenAI client and each :class:`Conversation` are thread-safe, so
    sharing them across the pool is safe.

    Results are returned in the same order as ``items``. The first exception
    raised by any task propagates once all submitted work has settled.

    Args:
        func: Callable invoked once per item.
        items: The inputs to map over.
        max_concurrency: Maximum number of concurrent in-flight calls.

    Returns:
        ``[func(item) for item in items]``, in order.
